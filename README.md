# Automated Endoscopic Image Classification via Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Class Imbalance Loss

This is the official implementation of Automated Endoscopic Image Classification via Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Class Imbalance Loss in PyTorch. We are submitting this article, so we first disclose the code of the loss function we proposed. The rest of the code will be made public once our article is accepted.

We also disclose the dataset which for  the binary-class classification task. You can click on the link https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_9MD98l7kibTZPBPY4NfeA to download and email us for the unzip code.
